# gokano_bot
A daemon python bot for collecting dailly point for gokano.

You only have to replace email and password values, and execute as "python gokano_bot.py". If you want to, you also can change the delay time between the requests. By default it's every 60 minutes.

Once it's a daemon, it will run on background. You can find the proccess and kill it by using "ps aux | grep gokano_bot" and "sudo kill -9 PROCCESS_PID".

Log will be on "gokano_bot_log.txt" file. 
In case of doubts, you can email lopesronanufsj@gmail.com. I'll be pleasured to help.
